# Analyze-NYSE--Data
This project will introduce you to the data analysis process that you will be using throughout the rest of the Nanodegree program. In this project, you will go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is for you to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.
